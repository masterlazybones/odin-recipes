    </p>
    <h3> <strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs (>=2)</li>
        <li>Butter (Butter goes best)</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper (if needed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Author's Notes: </h4>
    <p>I prefer my eggs to be cooked without salt as I 
        enjoy my eggs bland :D
    </p>
    <h3> <strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them until the mixture looks pale yellow and a little frothy.</li>
        <li> Grease the pan with some butter and heat until bubbles are seen.</li>
        <li> Make sure the pan is kept at low flame.</li>
        <li> Pour in the whisked eggs and let it cook for about 40 seconds.</li>
        <li> With a spatula, scramble the eggs little by little. Continuously scrambling the eggs would 
            make small, finely scrambled eggs. Scrambled eggs must be edible sized.
        </li>
        <li> Turn off the stove before your eggs are entirely cooked.
        </li>
        <li> Allow the scrambled eggs to cook in the heat of your pan alone.</li>
        <li> Transfer the eggs to a plate before it is entirely cooked. Enjoy those creamy scrambled eggs!</li>
    </ol>
